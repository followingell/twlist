# Twlist

As a Twitter user I often got frustrated by how little attention Lists had gotten compared to other features, it led me to tweet this:


> It still astonishes me how little focus Twitter has put into Lists. Could easily be the platform's 10x feature. Elliot Partridge (@followingell) [September 19, 2017](https://twitter.com/followingell/status/910256129904701446?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)


Later, I decided to do something about it and created Twlist. Twlist is an open, curated directory of the best lists on Twitter.
